            <p class="subtitle">Identifying America's most vulnerable communities through five years of air quality data.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="half">
        <div>
            <p>
                Air quality is often dismissed as a temporary inconvenience—a "smoky day" or a "smog alert." But for millions of Americans, poor air is not an event. It's infrastructure. Using five years of EPA data spanning 2021 to 2025, we mapped a crisis hiding in plain sight: <strong>37 counties</strong> where residents face both chronic daily exposure to elevated pollution and acute emergency events that spike air quality into hazardous territory. This analysis provides a roadmap for targeted intervention—from respiratory clinic funding to urban forest deployment.
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- The Concept -->
    <section>
        <h2>Understanding Double Jeopardy</h2>
        <p>
            We identified two distinct threats to air quality. <strong>Chronic exposure</strong> is measured by median AQI—the baseline air quality residents breathe on a typical Tuesday. This is often tied to permanent factors like industrial corridors or geographic basins that trap pollution. The top 10% threshold for chronic risk is <span class="highlight"><span id="chronic-thresh">0</span> AQI</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Acute events</strong> are captured by maximum AQI—the single worst day on record. These spikes come from wildfires, industrial accidents, or extreme weather that trigger emergency room visits and school closures. The top 10% threshold for acute risk is <span class="highlight"><span id="acute-thresh">0</span> AQI</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the real danger is where they overlap: <em>Double Jeopardy</em>. In these counties, residents' respiratory systems are already compromised by chronic exposure, making them far more vulnerable when acute events strike. This multiplicative effect transforms what might be a manageable "bad air day" elsewhere into a medical emergency.

    <!-- Chronic Exposure -->
    <section>
        <h2>The Daily Grind: Chronic Exposure</h2>
        <p>
            These communities face persistently elevated pollution levels year after year. The air quality index on an average day is what other counties only experience during emergencies. In the top 15 counties by chronic exposure, residents breathe compromised air <em>every single day</em>—365 days of exposure with no recovery window.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice the geographic clustering: California dominates this list with counties like Riverside, San Bernardino, and Los Angeles. This isn't random—it's the Central Valley and Southern California basin effect, where mountains trap pollution like a bowl. The chronic baseline creates a vulnerability multiplier: when acute events strike these areas, bodies already under stress face exponentially higher hospitalization risk.
        </p>

    <!-- Acute Events -->
    <section>
        <h2>The Sudden Shock: Acute Events</h2>
        <p>
            When AQI exceeds 300, health agencies recommend everyone—not just sensitive groups—avoid all outdoor activity. Schools close. Elderly residents face hospitalization. Economic activity halts. These are the counties that have experienced the most severe air quality emergencies over the past five years.
        </p>
        <p>
            El Paso, Texas recorded an average maximum AQI of <span class="highlight">604</span>—nearly twice the "hazardous" threshold of 300. Mono County, California saw readings over <span class="highlight">8,000 AQI</span>. These aren't measurement errors; they're real events affecting real people. The data reveals a critical distinction: counties with low median but high max AQI can rely on seasonal preparedness (mobile units during fire season). But Double Jeopardy counties need <em>year-round vigilance</em>.

        <h2>The Double Jeopardy Map</h2>
        <p>
            This visualization shows where chronic exposure intersects with acute events. The top-right quadrant—high on both axes—represents America's most vulnerable communities. Use the dropdown below to explore specific states or view the entire nation.

        <p>
            Notice the geographic pattern: <strong>68% of Double Jeopardy counties are in the Western United States</strong>. California alone contains 12 of the 37 (32%). This concentration tells us exactly where federal intervention would have the highest impact per dollar invested. The intersection of geographic air basins (valleys that trap pollution) with climate-driven events (wildfires, extreme heat) creates this regional crisis.

    <!-- Basket Analysis -->
    <section>
        <h2>The 37 Counties: A Basket Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            By isolating these specific 37 counties, we move from general awareness to <em>targeted, high-ROI intervention</em>. Every county in this visualization represents a community where standard pollution control measures aren't enough—they need Double Jeopardy protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
            The size of each circle represents the combined health burden (chronic exposure + acute events). Larger circles indicate counties facing the most severe compounded risk. Use the filter below to explore specific states.

        <p>
            California's dominance in this list (12 counties, 32%) reveals a regional crisis. The Central Valley's geographic bowl effect combines with wildfire-prone climate to create persistent Double Jeopardy conditions. Texas follows with 5 counties, concentrated in areas with both industrial pollution and extreme weather events.

                <h3>Risk Classification</h3>
                <p>Counties were classified based on two metrics:</p>
